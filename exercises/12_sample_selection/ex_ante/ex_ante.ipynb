    "In this dataset, you will use a part of the dataset from\n",
    "Conley and Decarolis (2016). The data contains bids for public procurement\n",
    "auctions for roadwork in Italy. In 2008, the Turing Court of Justice\n",
    "ruled that in 276 auctions for roadwork held between 2000 and 2003, the\n",
    "auctions had been rigged by 8 cartels made up of 95 firms. It turns out\n",
    "that the auction format, called the Average Bid Auction (ABA), is\n",
    "particularly susceptible to collusion between bidders. However, for a\n",
    "cartel to be successful at one particular auction, it is essential that\n",

    "perfectly competitive outcome, in which firms should not condition their\n",
    "bidding on the specific identities of their opponents. Thus, one simple\n",
    "tests of perfect competition might be whether the bid posted by a firm\n",

    "\n",
    "The issue is that firms are not randomly allocated to auctions. Instead,\n",
    "firms are more likely to participate in auctions that are close to their\n",

    "2.  Conditional on winning an auction, distance does not matter for the\n",

    "Of course, 2 may be criticized. The figure below shows the distribution of\n",
